WiseBot - a bot for Discord servers, created by my friend and me as a pet project. The main feature is the addition of fun, customizable sidequests to the gaming process. 
This bot has been actively tested and used on our private Discord server for more than 2 months. 
The main purpose of this pet project was to implement patterns and solutions commonly used in workplaces on a small project, to experiment and gain experience without fear of mistakes.
